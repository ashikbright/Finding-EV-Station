# Finding-EV-Station
The project addresses the challenge of efficiently locating the nearest electric vehicle (EV) charging station for users. By allowing users to input their current location through a user-friendly interface, the system utilizes geographical coordinates to calculate the distances between the user and various EV charging points. The solution streamlines the process of identifying the closest charging station, providing essential details such as location name, available charge ports, and charging speed. This functionality significantly enhances the convenience and accessibility of EV charging infrastructure, promoting sustainable transportation by assisting users in making informed decisions about where to recharge their vehicles in a timely and efficient manner.
